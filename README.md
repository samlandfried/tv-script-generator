# TV Script Generator

A machine learning project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. First commit copied from [Udacity's repo.](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation) Copied instead of forking because it's a massive monorepo I don't want to reproduce.
